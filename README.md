# What does that Python script do?
### Tired of creating new repositories for your projects everytime ?
I got you! :smile: The script simply asks you for the name of your repo, do you want any description and then simply creates a new repository for just 3 seconds! :scream:


## How to install and use the script
 First open Visual Studio Code and add your username and password for GitHub :computer: press **Ctrl + S** to save the file then simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` then run the script `python automate.py` And you are done! :sunglasses:
